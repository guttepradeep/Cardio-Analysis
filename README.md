# Cardio-Analysis

Cardio Analysis Project
Overview
The Cardio Analysis Project is a comprehensive data analysis project aimed at understanding cardiovascular health. Using a dataset of patient information, the project identifies trends, patterns, and correlations to provide insights into cardiovascular risk factors. The project leverages data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to deliver actionable insights.

Features
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explores distributions, correlations, and relationships among key variables.
Visualizations: Creates meaningful visualizations for trends, patterns, and insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Statistical Analysis: Identifies significant variables related to cardiovascular health.
Machine Learning (Optional): Uses predictive models to classify or predict cardiovascular disease risk.
